Revision history for POE-Component-Client-CouchDB

0.05    May 12 2008
        Eliminated dependancy on HTTP::Server::Simple::Dispatched for testing,
        we now use a mocked up Client::HTTP object that returns what we tell
        it to.  Also fixed document attachments not to cook their responses
        and added a test for that bug case.

0.04    May 9 2008
        Updated the pod-coverage test to not fail for some things it was
        failing for - CountParents is now on, and BUILD and DEMOLISH are
        considered private.

0.03    May 8 2008
        Reversioned everything per suggestion from confound, versions from
        here forward will all be the same (use perl-reversion --bump from
        Perl::Version)

0.02    May 7 2008
        Fixed a bug in the test that was causing it to fail instead of skip
        with no HTTP test server
        Fixed a documentation bug.

0.01    May 6 2008
        Initial release.
